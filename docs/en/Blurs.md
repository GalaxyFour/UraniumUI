# Blurs
UraniumUI supports blur effects on MAUI. You can use it on any control by using `BlurEffect`.

Apple has its own blur effect and Windows has a Brush for it. So it's implemented natively for those platforms.
Android platform doesn't support blur effects by default. So it's implemented in [Dimezis/BlurView](https://github.com/Dimezis/BlurView) and ported to C#.

## Getting Started

### Setting-up
Blur effect isn't part of UraniumUI by default. It's included in a separated assembly which is `UraniumUI.Blurs`. You have to add that package to your application first.

- Install [UraniumUI.Blurs](https://www.nuget.org/packages/UraniumUI.Blurs) package to your project.
    ```bash
    dotnet add package UraniumUI.Blurs
    ```

- After installing that assembly, you should add `UseUraniumUIBlurs()` method to your application builder in **Program.cs**.
    ```csharp
    builder
        .UseMauiApp<App>()
        .UseUraniumUI()
        .UseUraniumUIBlurs() // ðŸ‘ˆ Here it is
        .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
        {
            fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
            fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
        })
        //...
    ```

### Usage

BlurEffect is defined in `UraniumUI.Blurs` namespace. But its assembly exports that namespace by default. So you can use same xml namespace with UraniumUI.

```xml
xmlns:uranium="http://schemas.enisn-projects.io/dotnet/maui/uraniumui"
```

BlurEffect is a `Effect` which means you can use it on any control. 

> **On Android**, it's recommended to use it on a `Layout` such as `StackLayout`, `Grid`, `AbsoluteLayout`, `FlexLayout`, etc. to avoid overlapping issues.


```xml
<StackLayout>
    <StackLayout.Effects>
        <uranium:BlurEffect />
    </StackLayout.Effects>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</StackLayout>
```
